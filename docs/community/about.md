# About

Argilla is a collaboration platform for AI engineers and domain experts that require high-quality outputs, full data ownership, and overall efficiency. We are an open-source community-driven project not only focused on building a great product but also on building a great community, where you can get support, share your experiences, and contribute to the project!

Argilla was founded in 2017 by Dani and Paco. After, we joined the Data Pitch EU programme and built our first team. We iterated a lot on the stack and the UI, thanks to many enterprise customers such as Airbus, Reale Seguros, etc. At some point, we realized there was already a lot of valuable alternatives for training NLP models (spaCy and later Hugging Face), but not so many to focus on building and improving datasets!

We opened our office in Valencia in 2021 and launched Rubrix, our open-source project. In the beginning of 2022, we raised a seed round led by Zetta VP, SF and NY (Kaggle, Weaviate, Domino Data Labs, Feature Form), and Caixa Capital Risc, BCN. Due to some licensing issues we then also rebranded to our product Argilla. Along with the investment, we are growing our team with and office in Madrid and kept on adding key features to the product.

At the end of 2022, OpenAI released its ChatGPT model and Large Language Models LLMs became the talk of the town, which led us to shift our focus from predictive NLP tasks to generative tasks. This shift led us to launch our new LLM-oriented FeedbackDataset in 2023, which was one of the main drivers for success and the reason we got mentioned in that year's CB Insights AI top 100 list.

At the end of 2023, we also managed to organize our first off-site, and managed to celebrate the closing of our Seed round all together in Tenerife. Around that time, we also released our first open-source LLM called Notus and yet another open-source project called distilabel, which is a framework for synthetic data generation and AI feedback.

Early 2024, we got elected for that year's CB Insights AI top 100 list. Additionally, we had our second off-site in Cuenca after which we launched the 1.0.0 version of distilabel, and the 2.0.0 version of Argilla.

## Our believes

!!! Quote "AI in general"

    - Data quality is key to AI success.
    - AI should not be a black box, and AI is not magic.
    - AI is only worthwhile and useful in real business cases if the outputs are high quality and reliable.
    - AI is an iterative process that has no real “done” or end to it.

!!! Quote "LLM fine-tuning"

    - You must fine-tune if you want to get the best possible model.
    - Prompt engineering is not enough to build accurate models that can safely be deployed in production.
    - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) will only bring companies so far but to get the highest quality output, companies need to fine-tune their models on their own data.

!!! Quote "AI and human feedback"

    - Data labelling can be fun and engaging for domain experts aided by AI engineers.
    - AI Engineers can configure the right tooling through AI feedback from a combination of generative models, predictive models, and simple heuristics.
    - Looking at your data is critically important, most people talk about it but few actually do it.
    - By looking at your data and your model outputs, you can learn much more than just thinking about training.
